# Console-Finances

## Description
In this project I have created code for analyzing the financial records of a fictitious company. 

To do this I have combined variables, loops, conditional logic and multidimensional arrays with instances ES6. 

The records worked out include: 

*The total number of months included in the dataset.

*The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

*The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.

*The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

*The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

## Issues
The only issue I had was this challenge is that when it was set I wasn't confident in writing with Javascript and left it until later to create. 

## How to use
Open the html file index.html and visit the console. Here you will see the tasks set out in the challenged logged.
